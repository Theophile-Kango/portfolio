                        Alice Sisemore noreply@canadaimmigrationexpress.email Se désabonner 13:17 (il y a 1 heure) À moi Hi Theophile, Congratulations, you are on our approved participants list! Daily I go through a lot of candidates who leave their details on our site, candidates like you who really want to immigrate to the United States. Well, the reason you have my email in your inbox is that based on your profile, specifically, your country of birth, you are definitely qualified to participate in the Green Card Lottery Program & you have a chance to win a Green Card. The Diversity Visa Program (Green Card Lottery Program) only allows people who are born in certain countries to participate. The United States wants to have more immigrants from FR & you were born there – so, don’t waste this privileged opportunity!
